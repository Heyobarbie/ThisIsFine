# THIS IS FINE!!!
## A small game 2D game written in Python.

This game was written as a project to get familiar with Python and was handed in as holdiay assignment for the lecture 2022W 280446-1 Informatik. This game was written by me but with help of many Youtube and other online tutorials as well as the knowledge gathered through out the semester.
The game idea is inspired by the meme ['This Is Fine'](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine).
Special credits go to https://tilation.itch.io/16x16-small-indoor-tileset from which I used sprites and other resources to create the tilemap. Using these resources, the map was drawn with the open source tool '[Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/)' Version 1.9.2

All other sprites were created by myself and I chose the MIT license for all of my software and resources:
